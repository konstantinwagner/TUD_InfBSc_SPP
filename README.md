## rs_generator.sh
Simple bash script for creating lcluster jobfiles

### Installation
Go to destination folder (rs_generator) via `cd` command (IMPORTANT: Do not shorten this step!), then run `./install.sh`. If installation was successful, log out & in again (necessary). Don't delete this folder afterwards!

### Usage
Run `rs_generator` inside the folder you want to create a jobfile in & follow instructions. Append your own commands at EOF afterwards. That's it!
